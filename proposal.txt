    Estimating the number of distinct elements is required in many computing applications. For example, we may want to estimate the number of unique users accessing a service, or the number of different words in a text. This problem is known as count distinct or cardinality estimate and has been widely studied. In our research project we would like to build upon the same and implement the following counting algorithms. [To be filled in]
    After careful consideration, we have decided to build upon these problems and improvise upon these if possible. Moreover we will be trying to compare the efficiencies of similiar type of algorithms and try to find the best one for specific use-case scenarios.
